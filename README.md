Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

        -First go the the Windows page and look for download option
         -Click on the (Download now) to start your download
        -after completing the download run the installation and follow the given instructions to upgrade your current operaating system


2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

         -Go to the visual studio code download page
         -Choose the version and your suitable OS and download
         -Install and follow the given instrucctions

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

         -Navigate to the git page and download
         -Run the installation and follow instructions as usual
         -Look for your Gitbash and open it
         -check the version for your Git "EG" (git --version) 
         -Configure your git username and email
               -(git config --global user.name "Your Name"
               git config --global user.email "email")
         -Go the GitHub page to create your account as you will also create your first repo before going forward
         -clone your repo to your machine
               -(git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git)
         -Naviagte to your cloned repo and create a new file

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

         -Go to the python page and download 
         - Install python and also add/check its PATH 'Add it to Path'
         -verify your installation and version through gitbash
          (python --version)
5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
         pip is included in Python 3
            (pip --version)

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

         -Go to the MySQL and Download MySQL before downloading select version and your OS and select the second one 
         - scroll down and click start my download and make sure you have good connection
         -also visit the phoenixnap as it has all the needed instruction
         -run your installer but also choose the Developer Default
         -Follow the given instruction, set up the root password and complete your installation

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

         -Open your VS Code
         -Go to extensions its a square icon on your sidebar
         -search and install your extension choices
            -Python
            -Prettier 
            -ESLint
            -GitLens

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

         -Downloaded and installed Windows 11
         -Installed VS Code
         -Installed Git and created a GitHub account
          Initialized a repository and made the first commit
         -Downloaded and Installed Python and verified the installation
         -Verified pip installation with Python
         -Downloaded and installed MySQL, completed the setup with root password configuration and visited the phoenixnap page
         -Installed essential extensions in VS Code
         -Faced issues with configuring MySQL but resolved by following online tutorials

CHALLANGES 
         -Faced difficulties in configuring the MySQL root password and setting up the initial database
